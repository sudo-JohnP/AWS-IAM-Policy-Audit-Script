# AWS IAM Policy Audit Script

Built using Python and Boto3, this tool helps enforce the principle of least privilege by flagging over-permissive IAM policies.
The script scans your AWS account for customer-managed IAM policies and identifies risky permissions such as:

- ‚úÖ Wildcard actions (`"Action": "*"` or `"s3:*"`)
- ‚úÖ Wildcard resources (`"Resource": "*"` or global access)
- ‚úÖ High-risk actions (`iam:PassRole`, `iam:PutUserPolicy`)

---

## Why These Permissions Are Risky:

### 'iam:PassRole' -- Allows user to assign roles to resources in AWS (including higher priveleged roles!)
**Why's that risky?** -- Risks privelege escalation by an attacker as they could assign higher priveleged roles to a service to gain broader access.

### 'iam:CreatePolicy', 'iam:PutUserPolicy', 'iam:AttachRolePolicy' -- Allows users to create/attach policies to users/roles
**Why's that risky?** -- Possible security bypass through the attachment of admin-level priveleges.

### Wildcard Actions ('s3:*', 'ec2:*', '"Action": "*"') -- Grants access to all actions on a service/across all services
**Why's that risky?** -- Goes against the principle of least privelege. Also increases the possible impacts of leaked/stolen credentials.

### Wildcard Resources ('"Resource": "*"') -- Grants permissions for all resources in an account
**Why's that risky?** -- Even the smallest scoped actions can become dangerous when they're applied to **ALL** resources.

## Sample Output

Auditing customer-managed IAM policies...

Policy: TestAuditPolicy (arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/TestAuditPolicy)
 - Wildcard Resource: '*' found
 - High-Risk Action: iam:PassRole
 - High-Risk Action: s3:*
 - High-Risk Action: ec2:*

## üöÄ Project Steps

Below are the steps I took to build and validate the IAM audit script, with screenshots included.

### 1. Created a Risky Test Policy in AWS Console
I intentionally included high-risk actions like `s3:*`, `iam:PassRole`, and a wildcard resource `"*"`.

---

### 2. Ran the Python Audit Script
After configuring AWS CLI and running `iam_audit.py`, the script flagged the risky policy as expected.

### 3. Script Running in VS Code
The script was developed and tested in VS Code using Python and Boto3.

See [iam_audit.py](https://github.com/sudo-JohnP/AWS-IAM-Policy-Audit-Script/blob/main/iam_audit.py) for the script!
